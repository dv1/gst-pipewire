/**
 * SECTION:gstpwstreamclock
 * @title: GstPwStreamClock
 * @short_description: Clock based on PipeWire streams.
 * @see_also: #GstSystemClock, #GstPipeline
 *
 * #GstPwStreamClock implements a custom #GstSystemClock that is based on the
 * monotonic system clock, adjusted via rate difference quantities that come
 * from a <ulink url="https://docs.pipewire.org/group__pw__stream.html">PipeWire stream</ulink>.
 * Initially, the rate difference is set to 1.0, which produces timestamps
 * that are identical to that of the CLOCK_MONOTONIC system clock. The
 * gst_pw_stream_clock_set_rate_diff() is then called regularly whenever there
 * is information about the current rate difference between that system clock
 * and the PipeWire driver associated with the stream.
 *
 * This means that this clock can always be used, even if no stream is active.
